# Model Training Process

This document provides detailed information on the model training process used in this project. It explains the purpose and functionality of the model training process and includes instructions on how to configure and run the model training process.

## Purpose and Functionality

The model training process is designed to train machine learning models that can predict the priority and category of IT tickets. The process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The trained models are then used to make predictions on new IT tickets.

## Steps in the Model Training Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for training the model. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, new features are created from the existing data to improve the model's performance. This includes extracting technical information from the ticket descriptions and calculating various metrics.

3. **Model Training**: The preprocessed data and engineered features are used to train machine learning models. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Configuration

The model training process can be configured using the `config.yaml` file. This file contains various settings, such as the paths to the data files, the parameters for the machine learning models, and the thresholds for different metrics.

## Running the Model Training Process

To run the model training process, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all dependencies are installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare the data by running the data extraction and preprocessing scripts:
   ```bash
   python data_extraction.py
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

3. Run the model training script:
   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```

4. The trained models will be saved in the `models` directory. You can use these models to make predictions on new IT tickets.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the model training process:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Extract and preprocess data
python data_extraction.py
python data_preprocessing.py

# Train the model
python model_training.py
```

## Conclusion

The model training process is a crucial part of this project, as it enables the creation of accurate and reliable machine learning models for predicting IT ticket priorities and categories. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can configure and run the model training process to generate your own models.
