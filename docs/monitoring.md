# Monitoring Process

## Purpose and Functionality

The monitoring process in this project is designed to track the performance of the AI models and ensure they are operating effectively. It involves logging predictions, generating performance reports, and visualizing accuracy trends over time.

## Instructions for Configuring and Running the Monitoring Process

### 1. Configuration

Before running the monitoring process, ensure that the necessary configurations are set up correctly. The main configurations include:

- **Log File:** Specify the path to the log file where predictions will be logged.
- **Report Directory:** Specify the directory where performance reports will be saved.

### 2. Running the Monitoring Process

To run the monitoring process, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the ModelMonitor:**
   ```python
   from monitoring import ModelMonitor
   monitor = ModelMonitor()
   ```

2. **Log Predictions:**
   Use the `log_prediction` method to log each prediction made by the model.
   ```python
   monitor.log_prediction(true_label="Bug Report", predicted_label="Feature Request", confidence=0.85)
   ```

3. **Generate Performance Report:**
   Use the `generate_report` method to generate a performance report and visualize accuracy trends.
   ```python
   monitor.generate_report(save_path="reports")
   ```

### 3. Monitoring the Performance

The monitoring process logs each prediction to a log file and generates performance reports that include accuracy trends and classification metrics. You can monitor the log file and review the performance reports to track the model's performance over time.

### 4. Handling Errors

If any errors occur during the monitoring process, they will be logged in the log file. Review the log file to identify the cause of the error and take appropriate action to resolve it.

### 5. Customizing the Monitoring Process

The monitoring process is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can modify the process to suit your specific requirements. Some common customizations include:

- **Adjusting the log file path:** Update the path to the log file where predictions will be logged.
- **Changing the report directory:** Update the directory where performance reports will be saved.
- **Modifying the performance metrics:** Update the `generate_report` method to include additional performance metrics or visualizations.

By following these instructions, you can effectively configure and run the monitoring process to track the performance of the AI models in the AI Ticket Processing System.
