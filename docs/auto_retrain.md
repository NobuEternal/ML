# Auto-Retraining Process

## Purpose
The auto-retraining process is designed to ensure that the AI models used in the ticket processing system remain accurate and up-to-date. It monitors the model's performance and triggers retraining when necessary.

## Functionality
The auto-retraining process involves the following steps:
1. **Performance Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the model's performance using the `ModelMonitor` class.
2. **Threshold Check:** If the model's accuracy falls below a predefined threshold, the system initiates the retraining process.
3. **Data Backup:** Before retraining, the current model is backed up with a timestamp.
4. **Model Retraining:** The system retrains the model using the latest data and saves the updated model.

## Configuration
The auto-retraining process can be configured using the following parameters:
- `min_accuracy_threshold`: The minimum accuracy threshold below which retraining is triggered.
- `retrain_threshold`: The minimum number of new samples required before retraining.

## Running the Auto-Retraining Process
To run the auto-retraining process, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Model Monitor:**
   ```python
   from monitoring import ModelMonitor
   monitor = ModelMonitor()
   ```

2. **Create an AutoRetrainer Instance:**
   ```python
   from auto_retrain import AutoRetrainer
   retrainer = AutoRetrainer(monitor)
   ```

3. **Start the Auto-Retraining Process:**
   ```python
   retrainer.retrain()
   ```

4. **Schedule Daily Retraining Check:**
   ```python
   import schedule
   import time

   schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(retrainer.retrain)

   while True:
       schedule.run_pending()
       time.sleep(3600)  # Check every hour
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the AI models in the ticket processing system remain accurate and effective over time.
